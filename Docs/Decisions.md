# AI Context Packer - Architecture Decisions

## Project Overview
**Created:** October 25, 2025  
**Last Updated:** October 26, 2025  
**Framework:** WPF .NET 9  
**Pattern:** MVVM with full Dependency Injection

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Technology Stack
- **.NET 9 WPF**: Latest stable framework with modern performance improvements
- **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm**: Industry-standard MVVM toolkit for cleaner, maintainable code
- **Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection**: Professional DI container for service management
- **Newtonsoft.Json**: Reliable JSON serialization for settings persistence

**Rationale:** These choices provide a robust, maintainable foundation following modern .NET best practices.

### 2. Project Structure
```
AIContextPacker/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/              # Domain models and data structures
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ViewModels/          # MVVM ViewModels with business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Views/               # XAML views and code-behind
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services/            # Business logic services
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Interfaces/      # Service contracts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Converters/          # WPF value converters
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Helpers/             # Utility classes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Resources/           # Themes and resources
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Themes/          # Light/Dark theme definitions
```

**Rationale:** Clear separation of concerns following SOLID principles, making code maintainable and testable.

### 3. Service Layer Architecture

#### Core Services Implemented:
1. **IFileSystemService**: All file operations, tree building, path management
2. **ISettingsService**: Persistent storage of app settings and session state
3. **INotificationService**: User notifications (errors, success messages)
4. **IClipboardService**: Clipboard operations abstraction

#### Specialized Services:
5. **FilterService**: 3-stage filtering logic (Whitelist ‚Üí Blacklist ‚Üí .gitignore)
6. **PartGeneratorService**: Complex algorithm for splitting files into parts

**Rationale:** Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility. Interfaces enable testing and future extensibility.

### 4. MVVM Implementation

**MainViewModel:**
- Single source of truth for application state
- Uses CommunityToolkit.Mvvm for [ObservableProperty] and [RelayCommand]
- Handles all business logic coordination
- Manages file tree, pinned files, filters, and part generation

**Rationale:** Centralized state management prevents bugs from scattered state. MVVM Toolkit eliminates boilerplate code.

### 5. Filtering System (3-Stage Pipeline)

**Stage 1 - Whitelist (Extension Filter):**
- Only files with allowed extensions are shown in tree
- Default: `.cs`, `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.json`, `.md`, `.java`, `.py`, etc.
- Completely hides non-whitelisted files from selection

**Stage 2 - Blacklist (Ignore Filters):**
- User-defined filter sets (e.g., ".net", "angular", "python")
- Uses gitignore pattern matching
- Multiple filters can be active simultaneously
- Initially empty - user must create/populate filters

**Stage 3 - Local .gitignore:**
- Automatically detected in project root
- Optional checkbox to enable/disable
- Default: enabled if detected

**Copy Structure Special Behavior:**
- Shows files hidden by Whitelist (so AI knows they exist)
- Still respects Blacklist and .gitignore filters

**Rationale:** Progressive filtering gives users fine-grained control while maintaining good defaults. AI needs visibility of ALL files for context.

### 6. Part Generation Algorithm

**Key Requirements Met:**
1. **No File Splitting**: Files are never divided between parts
2. **Pinned Files Priority**: Pinned files go first, fill parts exclusively
3. **Validation**: Checks if any single file exceeds limit before processing
4. **Global Prompt**: Added to Part 1 if specified

**Algorithm Flow:**
```
1. Validate: Check if any file > maxCharsLimit ‚Üí Error if true
2. Add global prompt to Part 1 (if provided)
3. Add all pinned files sequentially (create new parts as needed)
4. Add selected files to subsequent parts
5. Each part stays within maxCharsLimit
```

**Global Prompt System:**
- Predefined professional prompts for different AI personas
- 10+ default prompts: Code Review Expert, Refactoring Specialist, Documentation Writer, etc.
- User can create/edit/delete custom prompts
- "(None)" option to skip global prompt
- Persistent storage in AppSettings
- PromptEditorWindow for management

**Rationale:** Ensures predictable, user-controlled output. Pinned files are truly prioritized. Global prompts provide context to AI for specific tasks.

### 7. State Persistence

**Saved on Exit:**
- All settings (limits, theme, filters, extensions, global prompts)
- Session state (last project path, pinned files, selected files, expanded folders)
- Recent projects list (max 10)
- Active filters state
- Selected global prompt ID

**Storage Location:**
```
%AppData%/AIContextPacker/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.json      # User preferences and configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session.json       # Current workspace state
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ recent.json        # Recent projects history
```

**Default Settings:**
- MaxCharsLimit: 10,000 characters per part
- Theme: System (auto-detect OS theme)
- IncludeFileHeaders: true
- 13 default file extensions supported
- 8 predefined ignore filter sets (empty by default)
- 10 predefined global prompts

**Window Closing Behavior:**
- Async save with proper cancellation handling
- Flag-based mechanism prevents double-closing
- Unsubscribes from events to prevent memory leaks
- Calls Application.Current.Shutdown() after save completes
- DispatcherTimer cleanup in ToastNotification on Unloaded event

**Rationale:** Users expect their workspace to be restored. Professional UX standard. Proper cleanup prevents processes from lingering after close.

### 8. UI/UX Decisions

**Theme System:**
- Light, Dark, and System themes with dynamic runtime switching
- System theme automatically detects Windows theme preference
- Themes defined in separate ResourceDictionaries (LightTheme.xaml, DarkTheme.xaml)
- Complete color palette with DynamicResource bindings for instant updates
- Material Design inspired colors: Indigo (#5C6BC0) for Dark, Blue (#0078D4) for Light

**Dark Mode Color Palette:**
- Background: #1E1E1E (VS Code dark)
- Surface: #252526 (elevated elements)
- Secondary Background: #2D2D30 (borders, separators)
- Hover: #3E3E42 (interactive element hover)
- Text: #E0E0E0 (high contrast, reduced eye strain)
- Secondary Text: #A0A0A0 (labels, hints)
- Primary: #5C6BC0 (Material Design Indigo - less aggressive than bright blue)

**Light Mode Color Palette:**
- Background: #FFFFFF (pure white)
- Surface: #F3F3F3 (subtle elevation)
- Secondary Background: #E8E8E8 (borders)
- Hover: #D0D0D0 (interactive hover)
- Text: #000000 (maximum contrast)
- Secondary Text: #666666 (reduced emphasis)
- Primary: #0078D4 (Windows accent blue)

**Custom Control Styling:**
- **MenuItem:** Complete ControlTemplate override to prevent system blue highlight in Dark Mode
- **ComboBox:** Custom ItemContainerStyle with IsHighlighted and IsSelected triggers
- **TreeView:** ItemContainerStyle with DynamicResource Foreground for text visibility
- **CheckBox:** Global style ensuring text uses TextBrush in all themes
- **ListBox:** Pinned files styled with proper foreground colors
- **Button Emoji Icons:** Explicit Foreground binding for visibility (üìå pin icon)

**Layout:**
- Two-column design: Selection (left) | Output (right)
- Pinned files shown above tree for visibility
- Filter checkboxes adjacent to tree for easy access
- Part preview with read-only modal window
- Toolbar with project selection, settings, and support button

**Visual Feedback:**
- Generate button disables after generation until changes made
- Copy buttons show success notifications via Toast system
- Part buttons change color after copying (WasCopiedToColorConverter)
- Tree items show pin status with emoji icons
- Loading indicator during project load
- Progress bar with current status text

**Toast Notification System:**
- Custom UserControl with slide-in animation
- Auto-dismiss after configurable duration (default 3 seconds)
- Four types: Success (green), Info (blue), Warning (orange), Error (red)
- Positioned in top-right corner, stacks multiple toasts
- Clean-up on window unload prevents memory leaks

**Support Integration:**
- "‚ù§Ô∏è Support Me" button in main toolbar (purple #FF6351B5)
- Dedicated SupportWindow with compelling value proposition
- Integrated into About window as highlighted section
- Buy Me a Coffee link: https://buymeacoffee.com/thelukcraft
- Emphasizes time saved and productivity gains

**Rationale:** Clean, professional interface following Windows 11 design language. Dark mode optimized for extended coding sessions. Support integration encourages sustainability without being intrusive.

### 9. Data Models

**FileTreeNode:**
- ObservableObject with parent/children relationships
- Tracks visibility, selection, pinned state
- Hierarchical checkbox behavior (selecting folder selects children)

**GeneratedPart:**
- Immutable output of generation process
- Tracks character count, copy state, content

**AppSettings:**
- Central configuration object
- Includes all user preferences and filter definitions

**Rationale:** Rich domain models reduce complexity in ViewModels and Services.

### 10. Error Handling Strategy

**File Too Large:**
- Modal error dialog with specific file name and sizes
- Blocks generation to prevent data loss
- Clear guidance on increasing limit or removing files

**Project Load Failures:**
- User-friendly error messages
- No crash, graceful degradation
- Recent projects validates existence before loading

**File System Access:**
- Catches UnauthorizedAccessException (system folders)
- Catches DirectoryNotFoundException (disappeared during scan)
- Catches FileNotFoundException (deleted files)
- Debug output for diagnostics without crashing UI
- Synchronous tree building in background thread (Task.Run) prevents freezing

**General Principle:**
- User always knows what went wrong and why
- No silent failures
- All catch blocks include diagnostic output
- Async operations properly handled with cancellation

**Rationale:** Professional applications must handle errors gracefully with clear communication. File system operations are unpredictable and must be robust.

### 11. Performance Considerations

**Lazy Loading:**
- Tree is built asynchronously on background thread (Task.Run)
- Filtering applied on-demand during generation
- Only visible nodes rendered in TreeView

**Efficient File Reading:**
- Files only read during generation phase
- Async I/O throughout (File.ReadAllTextAsync)
- Stream-based reading for large files

**Memory Management:**
- Large content stored temporarily during generation
- Cleared after parts created and copied
- GeneratedPart objects kept in memory for re-copy

**UI Responsiveness:**
- All file operations on background threads
- Progress indicators during long operations
- Loading status text updated via binding
- Tree building doesn't block UI thread

**Resource Cleanup:**
- DispatcherTimer stopped and nulled on Unloaded
- Event handlers unsubscribed on window close
- Proper async/await patterns prevent deadlocks
- Application.Current.Shutdown() ensures clean exit

**Rationale:** Handles large projects (1000+ files) without performance degradation. Prevents memory leaks and hanging processes.

### 12. Future Extensibility Points

**Plugin Architecture Possibility:**
- Services use interfaces ‚Üí can be replaced/extended
- Filter patterns can be extended with custom matchers

**Export Formats:**
- PartGeneratorService can be extended for different output formats
- Currently text-based, could support Markdown, JSON, XML

**Cloud Integration:**
- ISettingsService could be backed by cloud storage
- Recent projects could sync across devices
- Global prompts shared across team

**Multi-Language Support:**
- Resource files structure ready for localization
- All UI strings can be externalized
- Current: English (Tutorial, About, Support windows)

**Additional Windows:**
- TutorialWindow: 7-step guide for new users
- AboutWindow: Developer information and social links
- SupportWindow: Compelling monetization without being pushy
- SettingsWindow: Comprehensive preferences management
- FilterEditorWindow: Custom filter creation
- PromptEditorWindow: Custom prompt management
- PreviewWindow: Read-only part content view

**Rationale:** Clean architecture enables future enhancements without major refactoring. Monetization built-in early promotes sustainability.

## Code Quality Standards

### Applied Throughout:
- **SOLID Principles**: Every class has single responsibility
- **DRY**: No code duplication, shared logic in services
- **KISS**: Simple, readable solutions preferred
- **Minimal Comments**: Code is self-documenting via clear naming
- **Async/Await**: All I/O operations are asynchronous
- **Null Safety**: Careful null checking, nullable reference types enabled
- **Resource Management**: Proper disposal of timers and event handlers
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Event unsubscription on window close

### Testing Readiness:
- Service interfaces enable easy mocking
- ViewModels testable without UI
- Business logic isolated from presentation
- No static dependencies except for theme application

### Known Issues Resolved:
1. ‚úÖ Invisible directories in tree (exists check before adding)
2. ‚úÖ Recent projects not showing (ObservableCollection binding)
3. ‚úÖ Progress bar not displaying (IsLoadingProject binding)
4. ‚úÖ Scroll not working in tree (ScrollViewer.CanContentScroll="False")
5. ‚úÖ Toast notifications not showing (proper container setup)
6. ‚úÖ Part colors not changing after copy (WasCopied observable property)
7. ‚úÖ UI freeze during project load (Task.Run for tree building)
8. ‚úÖ Global prompt options missing (None option, proper ItemsSource)
9. ‚úÖ Settings not persisting (proper async save)
10. ‚úÖ Dark mode text invisible (complete DynamicResource styling)
11. ‚úÖ Application not closing (proper async shutdown with flag)
12. ‚úÖ ComboBox dropdown unreadable (ItemContainerStyle triggers)
13. ‚úÖ Timer leaks (Unloaded event cleanup)

**Rationale:** Professional-grade code that's maintainable by teams and AI assistants. All major bugs identified and fixed.
